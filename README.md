## 🙋‍♀️ My Contribution
I was responsible for the design and development of the following Tableau dashboards:

1. **Top 10 Exercises with Highest Calories Burned Per Rep**  
2. **Muscle Group Target Analysis**  
3. **Top Exercises by Total Calories Burned (Workout Score)**  

I also created calculated fields such as:
- `Calories Per Rep`
- `Workout Volume Score`
- `Needs Equipment (Yes/No)`

My focus was on visual storytelling around **workout efficiency** and **performance optimization**.
